should i nap,the question should i nap it really depends if you have a problem falling asleep at night the answer is no there is data to suggest that the last time you were asleep is directly proportional to how long it takes you to fall asleep so if the last time you were asleep was at 230 this afternoon you are probably going to have a pretty tough time falling asleep if you have insomnia as opposed to if it was 630 this morning so if you are an insomniac or you are someone who has a hard time falling asleep i think napping is out however if you are sleep deprived and socially speaking you can only get 6 and a half hours sleep but you really need 7 and a half then a nap during the day may be just the thing for you,[''],1.0

what causes hives,hives are produced when histamine and other compounds are released from cells called mast cells which are normally found in the skin histamine causes fluid to leak from the local blood vessels leading to swelling in the skin hives are very common although they can be annoying they usually resolve on their own over a period of weeks and are rarely medically serious some hives are caused by allergies to such things as foods medications and insect stings but in the majority of cases no specific cause for them is ever found although patients may find it frustrating not to know what has caused their hives maneuvers like changing diet soap detergent and makeup are hardly ever helpful in preventing hives and are not necessary for the most part having hives may cause stress but stress by itself does not cause hives in rare cases some hereditary others caused by bee stings or drug allergy urticaria and angioedema are accompanied by a striking decrease in blood pressure shock and difficulty breathing this is called anaphylaxis ordinary hives may be widespread and disturbing to look at but the vast majority of cases of hives do not lead to life threatening complications,['hives'],1.0

does resveratrol really work,resveratrol which is a compound found largely in the skins of red grapes has gained a lot of media attention and has been touted as having many beneficial health effects resveratrol is a component of ko jo kon an oriental medicine used to treat diseases of the blood vessels heart and liver it came to scientific attention during the mid 90s as a possible explanation for the “french paradox” — the low incidence of heart disease among the french people who eat a relatively high fat diet since then it has been touted by manufacturers and examined by scientific researchers as an antioxidant anti cancer agent and phytoestrogen it has also been advertised online as “the french paradox in a bottle ” if you do a literature search and look at well accepted peer review journals there is very little published to support any of these effects of resveratrol new work produced by both amgen and pfizer has cast doubt on the manner in which the health supplement is said to work prominent researchers supposed that it worked by activating a certain gene sirt1 this activation is thought to produce the benefits of a caloric restriction diet even among those with high fat and high caloric intake in 2009 in chemical biology and drug design amgen scientists published experimental results that indicate resveratrol does not in fact activate sirt1 pfizer scientists in the journal of biological chemistry in 2010 offered similar results showing that resveratrol and related substances such as srt1720 do not active sirt1 and did not reduce blood sugar in mice fed a high fat diet thus it suggests that resveratrol does not work at all though it is not possible to translate mice studies into human studies despite what is promoted on many national television shows on health none of the claims has been demonstrated in any valid human study while present in other plants such as eucalyptus spruce and lily and in other foods such as mulberries and peanuts resveratrol is most abundant natural sources are vitis vinifera labrusca and muscadine grapes which are used to make wines it occurs in the vines roots seeds and stalks but its highest concentration is in the skin the resveratrol content of wine is related to the length of time the grape skins are present during the fermentation process thus the concentration is significantly higher in red wine than in white wine because the skins are removed earlier during white wine production lessening the amount that is extracted grape juice which is not a fermented beverage is not a significant source of resveratrol since wine is the most notable dietary source it is the object of much speculation and research resveratrol is also available from supplement pills and liquids in which it is sometimes combined with vitamins andor other ingredients it is also an ingredient in topical skin creams the supplements are generally labeled as containing from 20 to 500 mg per tablet or capsule however the purity of,[''],1.0
what is less damaging smoking 3 cigarettes per day or picking two days of the week and smoking 10 on each of those days  i know that light smoking still poses significant risks i know i can still get cancer one day from doing it so please do not answer by telling me that i am looking to significantly cut down in order to lessen the damage i am doing to myself while still indulging a little in one of my favorite activities so here are my two options a smoke about 3 cigsday about 20week or b pick 2 nightsweek say two nights when i am out socializing and smoke about 10 on each of those about 20week,i wish i could give you a good answer but i do not think researchers have studied smoking at quite that micro a level in healthcare we measure smoking by the packyear  we calculate this number based on the average number of packs smoked per day times the number of years the person has smoked for example a person who smokes one pack per day for 20 years has a 20 packyear history a person like yourself who smokes on average 20 cigarettes per week which calculates to roughly 0 15 pack per day for 20 years would have a roughly 3 packyear history    the same as a person who smoked one pack per day for three years regardless of the manner in which you smoke a lot at one time or a few spread out over a longer period you are probably doing about the same amount of damage to your lungs and other vital structures intuitively i would think the damage would be worse from smoking many cigarettes all at once as opposed to smoking the same number spread out over a greater length of time rapidly introducing a volume of carcinogens and toxins probably is worse than trickling them in you sound well informed about the risks of smoking so i will leave you with one little tidbit did you know one of the more common cancers related to smoking is bladder cancer especially in men so the next time you light up ask yourself if you can envision the day when you will be emptying your urine through a pouch strapped to your thigh if not then you might want to re think the whole smoking thing wishing you well,['smoking' 'cancer'],1.0

what can cause a period to be late  i am 25 have always had regular periods and i am now 3 days late i had protected sex 4 days ago i have been under a lot of stress and not sleeping well could i be pregnant or what else could cause my period to be late,the healing of a fractured bone depends on many factors 1 type of fracture   compound fractures   take much longer to heal 2 displaced bone fragments   if the bone edges and parts have been displaced then the risk of delayed union and nonunion increase 3 infection   increases the healing time 4 disruption of the blood flow to the fracture site   also hampers healing 5 malnutrition bone disorders also prolong the healing time 6 early mobilization of the joint   before complete healing in your case you have 2 or more factors which have caused the delay in your recovery without first hand knowledge of your current condition examination of your xrays and a physical examination it would not be possible to give exact possibility of your prognosis i am sorry about that but platelet rich plasma prp does contain important cytokines and growth factors which when injected into a injured area helps to improve the rate of healing bone formation in your case and hence your recovery as mentioned in your history you may already might have had some progress hence if the fractured bone site heals completely which will eventually happen in due time   there is no doubt that you will be able to walk normally on the affected foot i hope this helps,['sexual intercourse' 'period' 'stress' 'pregnancy'],-1.0

i brush my teeth twice daily even then my teeth are yellow what to do,with emphysema there is permanent enlargement of the alveoli due to destruction of the walls between alveoli alveoli are the thin walled sacs in the lungs where gas transfer takes place  the destruction of the alveolar walls reduces the elasticity of the lung overall this loss of elasticity leads to the collapse of the bronchioles the small airways leading to the alveoli obstructing airflow out of the alveoli air becomes trapped in the alveoli and reduces the ability of the lung to shrink during exhalation the reduced expansion of the lung during the next breath reduces the amount of air that is inhaled as a result less air for the exchange of gases gets into the lungs this trapped air also can compress adjacent less damaged lung tissue preventing it from functioning to its fullest capacity the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen between the air and the blood in the capillaries takes place across the thin walls of the alveoli destruction of the alveolar walls decreases the number of capillaries available for gas exchange this adds to the decrease in the ability to exchange gases usually energy is required only for inhalation to inflate the lungs the stretch of the lungs and distension of the chest cavity springs back to rest during exhalation a passive process that does not require energy however in emphysema extra effort and energy has to be expended to empty the lungs of air due to the collapse of the airways this essentially doubles the work of breathing since now energy is required for both inhalation and exhalation in addition because of the reduced capacity to exchange gases with each breath due to the collapse of the bronchioles and loss of capillaries it is necessary to breathe more frequently,['dental scaling'],-1.0

what causes razor bumps and what i do about them,from a man is perspective the number one skin care problem would be ingrown hairs as a result of shaving when guys shave they scrape their face with a very sharp metal object this could be an electric or a manual blade razor the razor cuts each whisker leaving a sharp and often angled end facial hair is much coarser than the hair on the rest of your body as a result it has a tendency to curl just a bit when you cut each hair during your daily shave the razor leaves a very sharp end to each whisker hair when this hair grows just a little bit it tends to curl on itself pierces the skin and embeds itself into your skin this results in razor bumps and some of them will end up inflamed and infected how do you take care of this try the following suggestions · first when you shave i recommend a manual razor with a single blade the double and triple blades promise to give you a very close shave this sounds good but the closer you shave the more likely you are to have those hairs curling below the surface of your skin resulting in razor bumps and infected hairs · secondly shave in the shower by having your face very wet you minimize the likelihood of developing razor burn from too much friction · use a good lubricating shave cream or gel trial and error is my suggestion here no single product works for every person · after shaving make sure you moisturize your face no you do not have to use the perfumed products of your sweetheart there are very good men is products out there find one you like and use it every day · lastly when you shave shave in the direction your hair grows when you shave against the direction of your hair growth you may get a closer shave but you will increase the likelihood of developing ingrown hairs,[''],1.0

regarding an ultrasound what is the 0 day the date that the egg was released or fertilized by the sperm  i have received two different due dates during the earlier part of my pregnancy per the ovluation calendar my last menstrual cycle was 32days from the previous cycle first i was told i was x amount of weeks and 0 days and i was told i was x amount of weeks and 4 days i am trying to figure out on what day i possibly conceived,hi day14 is the most spoke about day for ovulation and depending where you read on all lengths of cycles so if you work from day 1 you need to have unprotected sex around day 9 or 10 this gives sperm time to get in place which takes 3 days and then can live for 5 to 10 days also depending were you read take into account day 14 its give or take a day so perhaps if its a day or two after then his sperm is sitting there just waiting for action but as long as your now pregnant unless you need to work out who the father is can you work it out from what is above and you would need to know what days you had unprotected sex on these are the most important days any sex before day 14 is where you need to be looking hope this helps you good luck,['ultrasound' 'sperm' 'pregnancy'],1.0

can a round object travel up from your rectum into your colon and get stuck,it is an interesting question if an object of any size or shape gets inserted into the rectum it can get stuck or as we like to say in medicine retained due to the strength of the external anal sphincter this is the powerful muscle that enables us to hold in or release stool when an object slips beyond the anal sphincter it can be very hard to get out you might be surprised how many people go to the emergency room each year to have a foreign object removed from the rectum however it is unlikely an object would travel up the bowel and deeper into the colon in the first place peristalsis a rhythmic contraction of muscles along the digestive tract naturally propels the contents of the intestines toward the anus for a foreign object to move against the effects of peristalsis would be akin to a salmon swimming upstream that is not to say it absolutely could not happen i guess never say never wishing you well,['travel' 'rectum' 'colon'],1.0

how is a damaged earlobe that had been pierced repaired,today with a wide array of products medications injections and skin treatments cosmetic plastic surgery is not the only route to looking younger and better the earlobes are pretty nifty gadgets they are utilitarian they can be pierced so that studs or earrings can be passed through the channel or earrings can be clipped on nature had a good idea to facilitate wearing jewelry sometimes the earlobes get into a little trouble for those with rather thin lobes who favor wearing heavy earrings after the lobes have been pierced there can be a gradual elongation of the ear piercing tract such that it becomes slit like and often too large another problem is that the earlobes can be torn by accident if undue pressure is placed upon an already elongated ear piercing tract through the natural forces of the heavy earring or even by a playful child tugging on a dangling earring the repair of such is not simple it is important that it be well done so that the earlobe looks normal and without overt evidence of having been torn and then repaired we favor a three layer repair done under hypermagnification it is an office procedure done under local anesthesia but it is very important to remove the damaged ear piercing tract or to trim the edges of a cleft if the earlobe has been torn through completely then the three layer closure consists of closing the outer layer of skin the fatty tissue between the two layers of the skin and finally skin in the back of the lobe typically the surgery must take great pains to avoiding any notching at the bottom of the earlobe such a repair is all technique dependent the surgeon needs to have the skill the experience and the patience to do a first class job people ask if the ears can be pierced again they can typically you should wait two months after the lobe has been repaired before initiating a repaired earlobe piercing,['injury'],1.0

can the appendix grow back  i have had my appendix removed back in 1989 i have had several scans ultrasounds over the past few years that have indicated my appendix looked good how can that be if it was removed is it possible it has grown back,well that is quite interesting is not it the appendix is not an organ capable of growing back in fact the appendix is not an organ at all it is an anatomical structure a tubelike sac that hangs off the large intestine where that structure meets the small intestine doctors and scientists are still debating what function if any the appendix performs so to your question first i would ask if you are positive your appendix was removed in other words was it taken out due to a case of appendicitis or was it removed in conjunction with another operation sometimes for example a surgeon will remove the appendix at the same time the gallbladder or an ovary is removed if that is the case maybe you were misinformed about whether it really was removed or not if you are positive the appendix was removed then i would say someone is misreading the ultrasound image it is possible they are seeing some fleshy tissue or fatty tissue and identifying it as the appendix hope this helps i do not have an answer to this question however in 2007 we discovered the appendix does in fact have a medical purpose to redeposit beneficial bacteria in the intestines when needed i e after a bout of diarrhea or when the immune system is compromised there are currently studies to determine the correlation of appendectomies and crohn is disease stating that we live in a clean enough environment to experience no problems without one is also a myth birth control alcohol nicotine steroids junk food etc etc all create a heavy burden on our digestive system do not quote me on this but i believe acne around the chin with red a red hue is a sign for digestive system problems and many toxins further exacerbate our intestines faster than they can keep up it would be interesting to see if a connection is made to immune system diseases and having appendectomies however it would be the case of the chicken and the egg was the body attacking the appendix first and then spread to other parts of the body or did having the appendectomy cause immune system diseases was it poor nutrition or bad genes that caused such a problem there is also medical purpose for tonsils as well as wisdom teeth as well as your frontal lobe lastly i hear up to 28 of the time appendixes are removed prematurely we at one point believed removing excessive amounts of blood would heal an illness we also at one point blew nicotine smoke up a persons rectum do not believe everything an expert tells you it is a science because we know only a scratch many illnesses are caused by behavioral trends of a society source due to this as well as my own adolescent idiocy i now have serious digestive system and brain issues and have spent hundreds and hundreds of hours researching how to heal myself through diet to no,['appendix' 'ultrasound'],1.0

experiencing right sided facial palsy for the 3rd time in 8 months,unfortunately you cannot spot reduce or target a specific area of your body for fat reduction it would be nice if you could get on the elliptical machine and say okay burn fat from my thighs today or okay sit ups get rid of my love handles  but that is not how it works instead fat is stored in special fat cells called adipocytes which are located all over your body the trick to reducing fat and losing weight is to stimulate adipocytes to release their stored fat and have the muscles burn it up exercise will do that for you and here is how it works when you start to exercise hormones like norepinephrine adrenaline are released into the bloodstream and transported via the circulation to adipocytes all over the body when these hormones reach the adipocytes they trigger special chemical messengers that instruct the adipocytes to release fat and just like a balloon that shrinks when you let air out of it adipocytes shrink when they release fat the released fat then circulates in the blood to the muscles which burn it up for fuel just like an automobile engine burns gasoline for fuel you lose weight when adipocytes release their stored fat and shrink and muscles burn up the fat as for spot reducing you can not do it because you have no control over which adipocytes release fat when you start to exercise we all have a consistent pattern of weight loss and weight gain you may lose fat in your face first and your love handles last but you can not control the pattern the good news is that all aerobic exercise stimulates adipocytes to give up their fat including the ones in your love handles and resistance exercises like weightlifting and abdominal exercises will tone up muscles under excess fat in fact you could tighten up your waist and loosen your slacks with abdominal exercises even if you did not lose your love handles to maximize the health and fitness benefits of exercise build up to three to five times per week of aerobic exercise for 30 minutes a session and perform resistance exercise two to three times per week all abdominal exercises on the floor will help try side bends trunk rotations and full body exercises like squats to help tone up the waist as always if you have not exercised in a while check with your doctor before beginning any exercise program,['facial palsy'],-1.0
i had laryngitis cough sore throat and fever and i am having lots of vertigo episodes,i am sorry to hear you are going through this it sounds very frustrating as you know hashimoto thyroiditis is a genetic condition in which the body is own immune system attacks the thyroid gland this makes it difficult for the gland to produce enough thyroid hormone to meet the body is needs although there is no cure for hashimoto is the usual treatment is thyroid hormone pills to keep thyroid levels steady i am not positive but i do not believe surgical removal of the thyroid  thyroidectomy  or destruction of the gland by radioactive iodine is a typical treatment for hypothyroidism in the absence of some other indication such as thyroid cancer an overactive thyroid gland hyperthyroidism that does not respond to other treatments may be treated by thyroidectomy i suggest you work more closely with an endocrinologist to get your medications adjusted perhaps you need to be monitored every three months for example also i would not be too quick to blame mood swings lethargy and chronic anger solely on hypothyroidism many many conditions physical and psychological can cause those types of symptoms perhaps seeing a counselor would be a good idea he or she could make sure you do not have any underlying depression and could also help you cope emotionally with the ups and downs of hashimoto is wishing you well,['laryngitis cough sore throat and fever'],-1.0

how does psychotherapy work is it more than just about venting your feelings,most patients think that they sign up for psychotherapy and they go in and talk in order to “vent” their feelings others think they are going it to see a counselor like a lawyer or financial advisor who will tell them what to do and how to behave some of this is true venting your feelings or “getting it all out” in a safe environment may be helpful in cases of grief where a loved one has died but i have also met patients who have had therapists where they have been venting every week for seven years… and they still are not better so venting is part of the process in some cases some therapists will tell you what to do and how to behave but this may not be a hallmark of a good therapist good therapists work with you in hopes that you see better ways to behave interact and function and act on those in your own way below are some concepts that govern certain types of psychotherapy yes just like there are several types of medications that work in several different ways there are different types and styles of psychotherapy analytical or psychodynamic therapy suggests that your past your parents your upbringing your environment your friends and all of the good and bad things that ever happened to you shapes who you are and dictates how you behave in the present if you learn about yourself and your past then gain insight into your patterns and behaviors you can learn to react differently in the future and your symptoms will gradually improve cognitive behavioral psychotherapy cbt suggests that patients have developed automatic negative and self defeating thoughts cbtdoes not care if problems came from your parents or elsewhere but cares that in the ‘here and now that you are suffering as your automatic thoughts for example i always fail i am never any good everyone always abandons me trigger negative emotions sadness anger despondency which you get stuck in and become depressed or anxious cbt therapists teach skills and resiliency in regards to fighting through and counteracting these negative automatic thoughts there are likely 20 other forms of psychotherapy each with their own underlying theory and process of reducing psychiatric symptoms,['psychotherapy'],1.0

can conjunctivitis in your eye happen from a common cold  have had a common cold that started 6 days ago woke up this morning with my eye stuck shut from discharge is this caused by my cold or do i need to see a doctor for medication from what i have read it sounds like this might be something that will clear up on it is own since i am pretty sure it is related to my cold,it is probably not so much the shampoo as it is the water that is affecting your hair color i have actually inquired from a lot of different companies and most of the shampoos if you look at head & shoulders for example does not affect your hair color so that is something that is very important to understand but what happens is when you color your hair the hair can become more porous and that means that everything you do to your hair can affect it more so sun exposure will make your hair more brassy and more dry because the sun also dries out your skin and takes the water out of your skin and your hair as well as well as the ultraviolet rays changing the color so that is something you want to be careful about do not stay in the shower for too long and do not let the water just run over your hair for more than ten minutes at a time use a conditioner and a shampoo that are specifically designed for color treated hair because they will coat the hair and give it some strength and volume and help protect that color from fading over time but it is more the water than the shampoo that is the culprit,['cold' 'pink eye' 'eyes' 'vision' 'coldness'],-1.0

how long does it take for hormonal birth control pills or injections to leave your system once you stop using them,your situation is very common and there are many possibilities for why your baby is waking up now 1 she could be teething even though teeth do not break through the surface of the gums until 6 to 8 months on average they can still be moving upward and causing pain 2 she could be having a growth spurt this might explain why the feeding helps 3 she is more alert and aware during the periods of light sleep at night also as she reaches the stage of separation anxiety usually around 8 or 9 months but could be sooner so may be looking for you 4 she is waking up out of habit if you feed her to sleep at the beginning of the night she may need to feed again to fall back asleep in the middle of the night 5 she could be hot cold in pain etc if this behavior keeps going i encourage you to see your pediatrician to make sure your baby does not have an ear infection reflux or other illness these are just some of the common causes of night waking that i see in my practice ,['birth control' 'injection'],-1.0

how long are you contagious to other people when you have sinusitis and tonsilitis,sinusitis and tonsillitis are not technically contagious exposing someone else will not necessarily give them you exact same disease it is the germs bacteria viruses that can be contagious but exposure to those germs will not necessarily result in the same or any disease since everyone is immune system is different viruses are the most common pathogens and most respiratory viruses that cause sinusitis or tonsillitis are thought to be transmittable by close contact for a day before you know you are ill and for 2 3 days later mono is a virus that can cause tonsillitis and mono is contagious for a longer period of time again exposure does not imply that someone would get anything else by a simple cold strep can cause both tonsillitis and sinusitis and this bacteria is contagious as long as you are contagious or until the end of your antibiotic course strep will not just jump out of your throat or nose onto someone else but sharing drinks kissing sneezing in someone is face can certain expose others if their immune system is susceptible to strep they can certainly get it sinusitis and tonsilitis are not contagious diseases so you may not worry of affecting anybody in your close vicinity,['sinus infection'],1.0
how effective is the seasonal flu vaccination,most helpful answer thanks for providing all the great background information if several different doctors have told you the blemish is a cyst then that is probably accurate a cyst is a pocket of tissue that is filled with some type of fluid the type of fluid can vary depending on the type of cyst some are filled with fatty acids while others contain pus it sounds like your cyst is located within the skin layer not in the breast tissue which is good news skin cysts are very common and do tend to drain occasionally as you have described the fact the cyst has gotten bigger and changed color is a good reason to have a health care provider re evaluate this it is possible the cyst needs to be treated by having it drained or even removed only your health care provider can say for sure cysts are an annoyance but luckily they are not a serious disease good luck to you as you cope with this,['flu' 'vaccination'],-1.0

is there a difference in sensitivity between a circumcised and uncircumcised penis,that is a controversy i have many patients including physicians as adults who have been circumcised and initially after the circumcision they are hypersensitive they can feel more than they like it is almost more uncomfortable than they can take and then it levels off some men will tell you that they do not feel any more or less after the circumcision some men feel very maimed that the sensation is dramatically lost if the foreskin is a sensory organ and they lose that there are other men that do not like having a foreskin that they find it to be a problem for them whether they find a lot of infection or maybe it is social maybe in the gym all the other guys in the shower are circumcised and they feel out of place there are risks to the surgery in good hands those risks are minimal but they can not be eliminated so the circumcision in newborns or adults needs to be looked at by you by your partner in discussions with your doctor as to what you feel is best for you as a family understanding that there are pros and cons to both sides usually an uncircumcised guy has more sensitivity because the nerve endings down there are left intact luckily for us cut guys there is an amino acid called acetyl l carnitine that repairs these endings and restores some of the lost feeling you can find it in a penis health creme called man1 man oil it contains other vitamins and nutrients as well great product hope this helps,['penis' 'circumcision'],1.0

can sleep deprivation impair my judgment,innocent by sleep deprived insanity that is what one man is saying in one of the strangest trials of the year maybe even the decade when i read about it i dug a little deeper only to find that the details of the trial were even more complicated than the claim of innocence here are the facts of the case pretend you are in the jury box * woody smith of dayton kentucky strangled his wife to death in may of last year * police records indicate that smith learned about his wife is extra martial affair and confronted her just before attacking her * he was then hospitalized for an overdose of prescription pills * his defense attorneys claim the violence occurred due to insanity brought on by lack of sleep as smith was allegedly having trouble sleeping because he was worried that his wife would leave him * according to his lawyers smith was taking caffeine pills and drinking energy drinks to get him through the day from my standpoint there are two questions to address here * can you really become psychotic or delusional from sleep deprivation * how can caffeine or energy drinks play into one is propensity to kill another human being first sleep deprivation itself can indeed impair someone is judgment and ability to think clearly but that does not necessarily lead to committing a murder second it does not surprise me to learn that perpetrators of crimes have laid blame on lots of things to justify claims of insanity and when used in an overdosage situation caffeine can produce paranoid delusional behavior while i do not know all of the specifics of this case i would find it hard to believe that the “red bull” made him do it and you might recall me blogging about the story of kenneth parks who killed his mother in law while he was sleepwalking he was found not guilty but then again… it is not the same as killing someone while wide awake though for someone like mr smith he is facing the possibility of a life sentence that no amount of restful sleep can take away we will have to see what happens here,[''],1.0

why is it important to screen patients with gerd to diagnose barrett is esophagus,unfortunately most cancers of the esophagus are detected too late to be treated effectively by the time cancer related symptoms of chest pain weight loss and progressive difficulty in swallowing dysphagia lead to the diagnosis the cancer has already spread beyond the esophagus to other organs indeed there is evidence that survival is markedly improved in cancers detected during the course of surveillance for dysplasia or cancer in barrett is esophagus as compared with survival in cancers detected after cancer symptoms prompted medical attention therefore physicians want to make the diagnosis of barrett is in gerd patients and then begin surveillance for cancer in such patients the problem however as mentioned previously is that only 5 of all patients with adenocarcinomas of the esophagus or cardia have had an endoscopy to show that they have barrett is esophagus thus the challenge is to identify those gerd patients who have barrett is by screening patients with chronic gerd yet sufficient research has not been done to establish guidelines for selecting which patients with gerd should be screened by endoscopy for now until more data becomes available it seems reasonable that if a patient with gerd cannot be taken off acid suppressing drugs after two to three years because of persistent symptoms an endoscopy should be done to see if barrett is esophagus is present one endoscopy per lifetime in patients with gerd may be sufficient to screen for barrett is,"['""barretts esophagus""' 'heartburn']",1.0

what causes childhood obesity,a recent study published in the british medical journal by russell viner at the ucl institute of child health london england caught my eye “childhood protection and obesity framework for practice  i know that my colleagues across the pond have been quite aggressive about finding creative solutions for countering the childhood obesity epidemic in england their academy of pediatrics has recently proposed a ban on junk food and beverage tv ads aimed at kids a stiff tax on sugary items and a requirement that fast food restaurants be located far away from schools but this bmj analysis takes the discussion to a different and understandably more contentious place should parents be blamed for their child is obesity intrigued i did some homework to share with you the childhood obesity child protection issue has emerged over the past several years garnering increased media and professional attention at the 2007 british medical association is annual meeting members rejected a motion in which obesity occurring in kids under 12 constituted a reason to charge parents with neglect and removal of the child into protective custody this action followed on the heels of a bbc survey of 50 pediatricians who noted that childhood obesity had been a factor in at least 20 child protection cases in 2006 the uk is not alone in its concerns which are evident internationally including us courts which have already been removing some obese children from parents considered neglectful here is an example from missouri where an boy was removed from his foster home because his foster father was obese the bmj authors examined the existing literature on childhood obesity and protective actions and suggested a blueprint for action what they found is that there is indeed evidence of an association between obesity and sexual abuse violence and neglect however there is no data on the relationship between child protection actions and weight control in the long term moreover there is no information about the long term physical and mental welfare of an obese child who undergoes removal from the home and placement into foster care the bmj authors note that obesity is part of a larger constellation of child welfare concerns related to child protection this means that all aspects of the child is family and living environment including nutrition and activity need to be closely assessed when determining what is best for the child is welfare to further complicate things there is good research that shows even when obese children have strong family support or ready access to credible weight loss programs kids can still struggle to remove the pounds they suggest that failure to comply with obesity treatment missing appointments not supporting obese children with weight management programs or even actively sabotaging their kids efforts is tantamount to neglect especially in those kids who are already suffering medical consequences arising from their obesity in reviewing the media coverage on this topic it is clear that the brits are more open to aggressive legal actions especially,['childhood obesity'],1.0

pill identification without an imprint this pill is white round and has a black l on it,although annual influenza injectable vaccination has long been recommended for people in the high risk groups many still do not receive the vaccine often because of their concern about side effects they mistakenly perceive influenza as merely a nuisance and believe that the vaccine causes unpleasant side effects or that it may even cause the flu the truth is that influenza vaccine causes no side effects in most people the most common and serious side effect that can occur after influenza vaccination is an allergic reaction in people who have a severe allergy to eggs since the viruses used in the vaccine are grown in hens eggs for this reason people who have an allergy to eggs should see an allergy specialist before receiving the influenza vaccine also the vaccine is not recommended while individuals have active infections or active diseases of the nervous system less than one third of those who receive the vaccine have some soreness at the vaccination site and about 5 to 10 experience mild side effects such as headache low grade fever or muscle cramps for about a day after vaccination these side effects are most likely to occur in children who have not been exposed to influenza virus in the past another type of influenza vaccine nasal spray is made with live attenuated altered influenza viruses this vaccine is made with live viruses that can stimulate the immune response enough to confer immunity but do not cause classic influenza symptoms in most instances the nasal spray vaccine flumist is only approved for healthy individuals ages 2 to 49 this nasal spray vaccine contains live attenuated virus less able to cause flu symptoms due to a designed inability to replicate at normal body temperatures this live vaccine could possibly cause the disease in infants and immunocompromised people and does not produce a strong immune response in many older people side effects of the nasal mist include nasal congestion sore throat and fever headaches muscle aches irritability and malaise have also been noted in most instances if side effects occur they only last a day or two this nasal spray has been produced for conventional flu viruses and should not be given to pregnant individuals or anyone who has a medical condition that may compromise the immune system because in some instances the flu is the side effect caregivers should read the vaccine precaution insert before giving any vaccine injectable or nasal as these inserts are occasionally updated,[''],-1.0

will my premiums go up i have heard that they will more than double under health reform,it is complicated it depends on what type of coverage you have now how much you earn and your age and sex if you have coverage through a large employer you probably will not see major changes however the requirements for large employers are still being sorted out if you buy insurance on your own in the so called “individual market” and qualify for premium subsidies based on your income see <link>  then your premiums will probably decrease if you do not qualify for subsidies and are younger or are a male your premiums will probably increase the reason is that the health reform law limits the ability of insurers to charge higher premiums to older consumers and females to make up for these lost revenues insurers will increase premiums for other types of consumers for employees of small firms the situation is more complicated the federal government will subsidize coverage for workers in firms with fewer than 25 employees firms with fewer than 100 employees can buy insurance through the exchange or marketplace firms may pass some of the savings on to employees in the form of lower premiums some small employers will offer more generous health insurance plans to comply with the requirements of the health law premiums will probably increase for workers in these firms higher income medicare beneficiaries may see their premiums increase under health reform,"['medicare' 'health insurance' 'affordable care act'

can a person get tonsilitis if they nolonger have tonsils my son had tonsilitis tonsilitis is a viral infection and does not require an antibiotic however tonsilitis can be caused by strep which is bacterial which requires an antibiotic dr did not do a strep test but perscribed an antibiotic a few days after he got better i developed an extremely sore throat runny nose caughing headache no fever tonsilitis symptoms can i get tonsilitis if i had my tonsils removed if i have a strep infection will my immune system fight it off,i will never understand that rationale of giving antibiotics to anyone that has a viral infection this is not good medicine most cases of tonillitis are viral and antibiotics are absolutely worthless and sometimes even harmful with that said first i assume you are a healthy adult most adults have relatively good immune systems that fight off viral and bacterial exposures 247 while the organisms may be capable of causing disease the organism has to find a susceptible host most of the time we just fight off those alien bugs if you do not have tonsils you can not get tonsillitis but you can get a viral infection but it does not mean it will be identical to your son who has a different immune system you may just get a stuffy nose or nothing at all in your case you did get an upper respiratory infection but it did not have to come from your son it could have been someone else and an entired different bug there are over 200 respiratory viruses capable of causing colds i get exposed to strep a dozen times a week and have never got it thanks to my own immune system and perhaps better handwashing and other precautions trust your immune system in most cases you will be just fine the cold that you most likely have now will likely improve in a few days on its own there is a slight different view my dad was a nurse and was told by a gp a a i am in the same situation as he was both my dad rip and myself have had tonsils removed however you can get all of the tonsillitis symptoms without having tonsils the only difference is where your tonsils were have the infection rather than the actual tonsils it just means that it is easier for you to be able to take paracetamol ibuprofen and other pain relief along with fluids as you will not have tonsils there to restrict the ability to swallow as much i had my tonsils removed when i was 4 and as an adult had tonsillitis many times as my doctor did not remove my tonsils beds i have been asked by doctors if i was sure it was my tonsils that were removed as symptoms so obvious later on in life i am now over 40 i have heard doctors say it is not that uncommon,['immune system' 'tonsil' 'fever' 'cough' 'antibiotic'],1.0

what is conventional medicine for a hernia,in the developed world girls now get their periods earlier and women spend less time being pregnant and breast feeding on demand this means that the average women can now expect to have more than 400 menstrual cycles in her lifetime eshre 2007 even the use of most hormonal contraceptives pillpatchring will yield a monthly bleed so it is no wonder that women are so concerned when their cycles seem to be longer and heavier than usual to address the most pressing question “when should i be concerned what is the medical definition of too much bleeding ” there is a medical definition of “too heavy periods ” if a woman is bleeding 80cc 2 7 ounces — about 13 of a cup or more that is excessive bleeding trying to measure exactly the amount of bleeding is difficult even in a research setting much less in a home bathroom some general indications of excessive bleeding can include * saturating a maxipad or super tampon every 60 90 minutes for several hours * passage of large clots quarter sized or larger * significant bleeding for more than seven days probably the most important factor would be if your bleeding is heavy enough to interfere with your normal activities so if your bleeds are too heavy read on for some possible explanations hormonal causes hormonal causes are usually linked to missed or erratic ovulation as you may know in a normal cycle estrogen is produced all month estrogen is responsible for building up the lining of your uterus so you have something to shed each month in a normal cycle progesterone production increases following ovulation progesterone “stabilizes” the uterine lining in preparation for a possible implantation of a new pregnancy if you are not pregnant that month the levels of estrogen and progesterone fall triggering the release of the uterine lining — your period so if you do not ovulate the estrogen build up of the lining continues but without the usual ovulation associated progesterone thus the hormone levels do not decline and the lining stays up inside the uterus as a missedlate period alternatively the lining can begin to shed under its own weight producing prolonged bleeding after several months of missed periods the lining of the uterus can become very thickened prolonged and heavy flows are not uncommon after months of missed flows there are many causes for not ovulating including low thyroid a benign pituitary growth “adenoma” or a problem with the hypothalamus all of the stress related causes of not ovulating e g sudden increases in exercise crash dieting problems with relationships financial worries etc  can be linked to the effects of stress hormones from the brain on the hypothalamus increased body weight may trigger hormone changes leading to polycystic ovarian syndrome pcos a transient ovarian cyst can halt ovulation for a time there are treatments for each of the causes of heavy bleeding we have discussed so if you or someone you know have episodes,['hernia' 'drug'],-1.0

circumcision as a cure for bed wetting we are currently living in a developing country our 12 year old son wets his bed almost every night we used to have a beeper that would trigger when he was starting to urinate at night but the device broke down and we cannot get one here it seemed effective though  now a phycisian here suggests to perform a circumcision in order to solve the bed wetting issue i am wondering if this really is a standard solution and if there is scientific research proving this,ridiculous most of the men and boys on this planet are uncircumcised just the way god made them uncircumcised boys do not wet the bed more than circumcised boys and going through this unnecessary and painful procedure for a 12 year old is not a cure for his bedwetting the only exception would be if his foreskin was so tight that he is having difficulty urinating and his foreskin is ballooning from trapped urine when he pees even then there are ways of fixing a tight foreskin without circumcision there are medications that can help assuming you can get them in your country that can really really help desmopressin ddavp is what i have used for years for bedwetting and in my opinion works like a charm in the vast majority of bedwetters one major cause of bedwetting is the lack of adh anti diuretic hormone a hormone that reduces the amount of urine that is produced at night if a young boy does not have enough of this natural hormone the body will continue to produce urine at the same rate is day time not something that is desirable desmopressin replaces this hormone clearly his doctor is suggesting a surgery and i absolutely do not agree with this unorthodox approach consider seeing a child endocrinologist even if you have to travel to a larger city or at least suggest desmopressin as a non surgical approach your son needs help bedwetting is embarrassing and it is not his fault,['urination' 'circumcision'],1.0

i just finished my chemo treatment and want to know how i can tell if i am going to have neutropenia,should every child be screened for high cholesterol that is an issue currently up for debate the current recommendations from the american academy of pediatrics say no as it stands right now there are only certain children who are screened those include * children who have a parent or grandparent diagnosed with heart disease at or under 55 years of age * children who have a parent or grandparent who have had a heart attack heart related chest pain vascular disease or sudden cardiac death at or under 55 years of age * children who have a parent with an elevated blood cholesterol level of 240 mgdl or higher * children who are diagnosed with obesity but a recent study questions if practitioners are missing a significant number of children who might be identified with elevated cholesterol levels having that awareness might encourage families to be stricter about enforcing a healthy diet and exercise routine and some kids might actually need to be treated with cholesterol lowering medications the study found that almost 10 percent of kids who would not be tested under the current guidelines have elevated levels of ldl cholesterol bottom line just relying on a family is history of high cholesterol may be an insufficient screening tool to determine who needs a blood cholesterol level drawn but even if your child has not been diagnosed with high cholesterol it is a good idea for everyone to follow the advice of the american heart association — maintain a low fat diet for all kids ages two and up and encourage your whole family to take time for exercise every day,[''],-1.0

i have heard soy milk contains estrogen and causes man boobs if consumed by men does almond milk have the same issue,hi found you this answer from netdoctor co uk it should interest you as its all about your little problem inverted nipples are quite common but women are not often aware of this because it is not a popular topic of conversation inverted nipples are sometimes regarded with a degree of embarrassment although there is no reason for this i do not think your own situation is going to be too much of a problem because your nipples are capable of coming out becoming everted this is probably more noticeable when you are cold or aroused your nipples contain some erectile tissue that causes them to become more prominent the biological reason for this is to aid breastfeeding although your nipples may be flat or inverted a lot of the time when the erectile tissue is stimulated they stick out you can encourage them to be more permanently erect by rolling the nipples between thumb and forefinger frequently perhaps several times a day over a period of time also gently pulling on the nipple when it is erect can help make this state more permanent you can also buy nipple shields to use these are designed really for women in pregnancy who want to improve their chances of breastfeeding but there is no reason why non pregnant women can not use them they consist of a circular plastic disc with a central hole the disc exerts pressure on the tissue around the nipple and encourages the nipple to protrude through the central hole they can be worn at any time in pregnancy many women find their flat or inverted nipples become everted anyway in association with the breast changes and enlargement of pregnancy i certainly would not advise surgery for this benign condition yours sincerely the netdoctor medical team do hope this helps you good luck,['estrogen' 'almond' 'milk' 'soy milk'],-1.0

why has not my period come yet  i am 13 and i want to know why my period has not come yet i have all the signs pubic hair arm pit hair cramps nausea and discharge for 2 years i do not understand will someone please explain,if you are traveling west what time of day is your flight actually can be a pretty big factor for you so if you are normally a pretty sleep deprived person you may use a 3 or 4 hour plane flight to get a little bit of extra rest be careful because when you arrive if it is near nighttime you may not be able to fall back asleep so if you are going to use the plane to allow yourself to get more sleep i would say i want you traveling in the morning because that leaves you a lot of time to get tired during the day so you can fall asleep at night if you are traveling in the opposite direction then the opposite would be true then you would want to travel more towards the evening because then it is closer to time for bed what is in my travel sleep kit is usually eye shades ear plugs some sort of clip for the drapes when you go to hotel rooms usually the air conditioner is right underneath the drapes and it parts the drapes and the sun kind of hits you in the morning so have something for the drapes when you check into your hotel ask if you can be placed on a top floor because that is usually far away from street noise you want your room to be facing west and not east so you do not want to get the sun early in the morning and ask if there is a way you can be placed not next to families with small children a hockey team whatever because the noise factor can be a big one i have actually had some patients tell me that they sleep better on the road than they do at home because at home they do not get interruptions it is not nearly as stressful because they are not dealing with big emotional issues usually on the road so i have had many people tell me that they they do pretty well they get used to sleeping on the road for those folks what i often tell them is try to stay in the same hotel try to stay in the same rooms so you can increase your familiarity have your travel sleep kit the other thing that is good is to add a night light to your travel sleep kit the reason is when you wake up in the middle of the night if you have been entertaining drinking alcohol or coffee you do not want to flip on the light because then that tells your brain that it is daytime some people have a difficult time sleeping in a hotel because it is unfamiliar and they are fearful from a safety perspective and so there are door alarms that you can hang over your door so that if anybody jiggles the handle an alarm will sound that will usually have them move away and,['period' 'hair' 'arm' 'cramps' 'nausea'],-1.0

can dexedrine taken to treat narcolepsy be effective past the expiration date  can dexedrine taken to treat narcolepsy be effective past the expiration date,in general we recommend people not take medications beyond their expiration date why because these medications may lose potency strength or they may otherwise degrade if active ingredients in the medication degrade they may not work as they should in the case of any specific medication like dexedrine you should consult your healthcare provider or a pharmacist these professionals can help you determine if it is safe or not to take the medication generally i would say it is not by the way it is also important to follow the storage instructions indicated on the medication package for example many medications need to be stored in a cool dry place  this is because heat can cause drugs to degrade rapidly if your medications have been exposed to temperatures over about 80 degrees fahrenheit for a prolonged period of time they may not work as expected the shelf life of medications goes down if they have been kept in high heat conditions this means they may expire even before the date printed on the label wishing you well,['narcolepsy'],1.0

i have a speaking disorder is there surgery or medication that can help,i am sorry to hear you are going through this it sounds very unpleasant first just to clarify an iud is an intrauterine device  it is an implant that goes inside the uterus i think what you meant to say is you had birth control implants rods removed from your upper arm you do not say when you had this procedure done but it is not unexpected you would experience bruising possibly considerable bruising since the inside of the upper arm is a very tender area and pain for the same reason you also would experience swelling which is a normal response to having a minor procedure like the rod removal it is also not abnormal for the stitches to ooze for the first 24 hours after you have the birth control rods taken out your health care provider should have given you some instructions about what to do regarding the stitches sutures generally speaking you should be able to gently cleanse the stitches using lukewarm water and plain soap pat dry apply an antibacterial ointment such as triple antibiotic ointment or neosporin to the sutures as long as you are not allergic to any of the ingredients in the ointment many people fear any wound will become infected so they monitor closely for what they believe is pus coming from the wound usually any fluid you see oozing from a wound is not pus but is simply part of the natural healing process it takes several days for an infection to develop so if you just had the birth control rods removed today it would be virtually impossible for you to be experiencing symptoms of an infection where the rods were removed if it has been more than three days since you had the rods removed and you are experiencing symptoms the next step is to take your temperature using a thermometer if you have a fever over 101f then you may indeed have an infection you should seek medical treatment in general you can elevate your arm apply ice packs and take an over the counter pain reliever to help ease the situation at any rate if you are concerned about what is going on you should contact the health care provider who removed the birth control rods he or she is in the best position to advise you how to proceed wishing you well,['i have a speaking disorder'],-1.0

how long does jet lag last,if you have ever traveled and experienced jet lag you know that you can feel that you are just not quite fully functioning particularly when traveling east when you arrive at your destination a new study shows that this particular effect of jet lag may linger longer than we realize researchers at the university of california at berkeley conducted an interesting experiment they used an animal model in which they compared the performance and memory tasks of jet lagged hamsters against a control group the researchers learned that jet lag affects the part of the brain responsible for memory and learning * it limits the growth of brain cells and reduces brain activity * it leads to memory and learning problems * even a month after recovering subjects were still suffering from its effects lance kriegsfeld uc berkley associate professor of psychology and study author commented “what this says is that whether you are a flight attendant medical resident or rotating shift worker repeated disruption of circadian rhythms is likely going to have a long term impact on your cognitive behavior and function ” i could not agree with him more anyone who travels or works a rotating shift can experience jet lag and not even realize it since this was an animal experiment we can not ask the participants if they noticed feeling any different or if they had any difficulty learning something new even so this study sheds light on some astounding implications of jet lag for various professionals * pilots learning new flight routes * medical residents practicing new surgical techniques or recognizing unfamiliar states of diseases * shift workers dealing with different job responsibilities rotations or assembly methods jet lag could be the cause of many simple errors i have written about jet lag before “jet lag” is usually the result of crossing several time zones in a short period of time without allowing for your body to time to adjust for the changes in time your body will typically adjust at the rate of one to two time zones per day so if you cross six time zones your body will naturally make the adjustment to the time change in about three to five days though shift workers may not physically cross over time zones their days and nights fluctuate according to their work schedule which throws off their biological clock whether you are traveling across the country or picking up a holiday shift here are some simple things to help fight jet lag keep your brain healthy 1 time your flights if you are only flying over two to three zones avoid the “red eye” flights as much as possible remember jet lag is worse if you traveling east 2 get outside and get some sunlight light helps re set your circadian rhythm and reduces the effects of jet lag 3 adjust with exercise exercise also helps re set your biological clock i would not suggest running a marathon but while you are outside,['jet lag'],1.0

i can not get rid of scabies is there a new medicine for scabies,my response is intended to be helpful and offered with respect i would never protect the actions of a rouge doctor or support an inappropriate medical decision in my opinion this doctor did not cross any ethical or legal lines if you were appalled why did not you question this action when it was made the doctor could have immediately answered your question and explained their reasoning but was not given an opportunity you suggest in your question that the doctor should have prescribed something for pain well that is exactly what happened the oxycodone still in your mother is possession is used as an agent to control pain would you have felt better if the doctor had written a new prescription for oxycodone how did the doctor know that your mother still had oxycodone remaining from her dental treatment that information must have been volunteered by the patient upon learning that your mother already had pain medication available why not use it as long as the oxycodone was originally prescribed for your mother and had not reached its expiration date the doctor is action was acceptable perhaps the doctor wanted to save your mother time in waiting at the pharmacy or wanted to save her some money i can only guess the reasons for his decision in summary doctors are licensed to prescribe medications in various fashions these may include suggesting over the counter drugs providing the patient with factory packaged free sample drugs loose free sample medications placed in a bag with dosing instructions hand writing a new prescription for pharmacy dispensing directing office staff to administer medications provide over the phone orders to the pharmacy email and fax prescriptions sent directly to the pharmacy and even advising a patient to resume medications previously prescribed by another doctor they even have the authority to prescribe medications for conditions that were not intended or approved to be treated with that drug this practice is referred to as off label prescribing for example some anti seizure medications are also prescribed to treat pain mixed in with those prescription authorization practices and customs is the necessity to determine who really requires pain medications and who are the individuals that may be manipulating the system in order to feed a drug addiction or to make some street money doctors have awesome powers and responsibilities in properly prescribing medications they spent years studying anatomyphysiology chemistry biology disease processes and pharmacology they are keenly aware of approaches used to control pain and must first do no harm,['scabies' 'drug'],-1.0

my 11 year old recently started her period she has a period every 14 days and it lasts for six days is this normal,yes this can be common as it can take up to two years after the first period for the ovaries to completely mature and produce regular ovulations every month in the early years of menstruation estrogen production is more than adequate to build up a thickened lining in the uterus but without regular ovulations not enough progesterone is made as you may know in a normal cycle estrogen is produced all month estrogen is responsible for building up the lining of your uterus so you have something to shed each month in a normal cycle progesterone production increases following ovulation progesterone stabilizes the uterine lining in preparation for a possible implantation of a new pregnancy if you are not pregnant that month the levels of estrogen and progesterone fall triggering the release of the uterine lining—your period so if you do not ovulate the estrogen build up of the lining continues but without the usual ovulation associated progesterone thus the hormone levels do not decline and the lining stays up inside the uterus as a missedlate period alternatively the lining can begin to shed under its own weight producing prolonged and erratic bleeding  this is likely what has happened to her another way inadequate progesterone production from missed ovulations can create too heavy a flow is as follows simply stated if the uterine lining is like grass or lawn estrogen is like the fertilizer causes proliferation and a thickening of the lining  and progesterone is like the lawnmower keeps the lining thin by three different mechanisms this is why depoprovera high dose synthetic progesterone brings about a thin lining and why birth control pills relatively progesterone dominant bring about shorter lighter periods it is also why women who miss ovulations no progesterone produced are at a greater risk for too thick lining lastly less than 10 of adolescent women with heavy menstrual bleeding have an undiagnosed blood clotting disorder this would be more likely if she had a family history of von willebrand is syndrome given the duration of her bleeding i would urge you to have her see either your gyn a pediatrician or your family md a short course of hormones may be helpful in stopping this distressing bleeding pattern yes it is nothing to worry about this could mean instead of one egg a month she produces 2 i get mine every 14 das alsoand always have and i am 22 my mom had the same thing,['period'],1.0
how often to feed a 5 month old dry cereal,that is a great question and it all depends on how frequent your heartburn is if you just have an occasional bout of heartburn for instance you ate a spicy meal then you can use a regular antacid a maalox or a mylanta product you want to make sure though that you shake it really well a lot of people forget about that also too if you are taking medications you may need to space it either take it an hour before you take your medications or two hours afterwards because it can actually bind to the medicine and therefore the medicine will not work as well if you notice though that you have like two days in a row where you have had consistent heartburn then you may want to try a h2 blocker pepcid is one consideration zantac you want to talk to your pharmacist though and let us know if you are taking any other medications zantac has a tendency to interact with other medicines so if you have your medication list handy we can take a look at it and make sure there is no potential for drug interactions if it is two or more episodes a week that you are experiencing heartburn then you are going to want to go towards the proton pump inhibitor and prilosec otc is an example of that you want to use it for 14 days but once again you want to talk to your pharmacist to make sure that you are not taking any other medicines or possibly taking any duplicate medicines that could do the same thing then also if you are not feeling well after the 14 days a pharmacist is probably going to refer you back to your doctor or healthcare provider because it probably needs a little bit more evaluation,['feeding' 'cereal'],-1.0

what is the relationship between genes and environment with regard to autism,it is now clear that there is not a single cause of autism—just like there is not a single cause of cancer or heart disease as with many complex real world disorders both environmental and genetic causes play a role some recent studies are helping us understand the complex interrelationship between these causes a study of 192 twin pairs published in november 2011 tried to isolate environmental versus genetic causes by comparing identical to fraternal twins identical twins have the same genes fraternal twins have the same parents but are not any more similar genetically than any other pair of siblings using fancy math these researchers confirmed that there are both genetic and environmental causes—and that the influence of both was about in the 50 50 to 60 40 range however twin pairs share identical environments before they are born which makes it difficult for studies like this to separate genetic from environmental factors that occur before birth which brings us to another study this one based on autopsies that studied the brains of children with autism versus matched neurotypical kids researchers looked closely at brain structure and found that children with autism had far more neurons packed into certain areas of the brain than children who are unaffected this difference in fundamental brain architecture had to arise very early probably within the first one or two trimesters of pregnancy—that is when neuronal development and cell growth takes place if confirmed this study supports the idea that very very early influences are critical and that children who are destined to have autism may well already have the disorder at birth even if manifestations are not seen yet there are many potential influences on brain development that occur early in pregnancy and many factors to consider stress infections nutrition genetics and other exposures an example of one such environmental trigger was revealed in another recent study which showed an increase in autism among children whose mothers took antidepressant medications early during their pregnancies while medication exposures could not account for all cases they could certainly be one of many potential exposures that may interact with genetic factors to cause autism,[''],1.0

why are neighborhood medical spas “buyer beware”,medical spas buyer beware because a medical spa implies that there is some medical treatments often there is a staff physician or a nurse as opposed to just a traditional day spa and so yes there are procedures that are offered the question is whether that is the best environment for that why would it not be well it depends on how much on site supervision there is by a physician and what is the physician is specialty because by routine typically there is a dermatologist or a cosmetic surgeon available and sometimes on site but for some spas the so called medical director could be a pediatrician it could be a heart surgeon participating in a business enterprise you just need to know that you have to have a license to be a medical director but the question is what specialty is that licensed doctor carry how can a pediatrician or a heart surgeon actually do cosmetic procedures that does not even make sense well they are really not doing the procedures in some of the spas and i am not saying that this is the rule but there are some that we know about they do not do them they are really done by often very experienced and sophisticated nurse practitioners who specialize in that type of work but there are some medical issues that can come up particularly suitability should one have such and such a procedure a given skin peel or the injections because not everyone is a candidate for these things it is not like shopping at a supermarket where you just take something off the shelf there has to be some consideration for the right substance the right treatment and for the right skin and the right type of person in respect to their health so that is where the system breaks down if in fact the supervising doctor has not been raised in the world of cosmetic surgery and are most of them raised in the world of cosmetic surgery dr kotler most most are raised in the cosmetic surgery world but not all and we do hear stories about physicians kind of migrating in to the medical spa because it is uhm it is a business it is an investment opportunity or often the spa may be owned by business men and they have appointed dr x to be the quote medical director but it is good to have a sense of who is at the controls who is responsible and who will be there if there is a problem 15 all medical treatments have some potential for you know delayed healing some minor complications who is going to be the backup now let is say that there are doctors on hand are those necessarily well trained doctors that can vary typically you see in a spa the doctor would not be there all the time because he has to spend most of his time in the office or in the operating,[''],1.0

i have no fever but my skin feels hot what does that mean  this usally happens mid day and what happens is the core of my body gets hot my skin is hot to the touch and i feel as though the sun is shining from the inside of my body outwards it is very frusterating because no matter if i turn the ac on or run ice over my skin in a few minutes the same inner hot feeling comes back,i am sorry you are going through this and that it is concerning you the skin is an amazing organ one thing it does is function as sort of a radiator for the body in the sense that blood vessels in the skin is surface become enlarged to release heat when the core of the body gets too warm this engorgement of the blood vessels in the skin can cause flushing a red appearance and may make the skin feel hot the body releases excess heat this way in order to avoid overheating the core i guess my question would be why is your body getting so hot at midday is it because you are exercising for example are you going through menopause and experiencing hot flashes or do you just get unbearably hot at the same time every day our body temperature tends to fluctuate throughout the day but if you are getting uncomfortably hot every day at the same time with no known cause it would be worth discussing this with your doctor at your next visit i mean it sounds as if your body is functioning normally your core gets hot so your skin releases the heat but perhaps there is some underlying cause for this that should be checked out i wish you all the best with this i have a question for you do you have a hard time sweating or perspiring the purpose of sweating is to keep our bodies from overheating over the years i have found that since i have a problem sweating my body has no way of releasing the heat and therefore anyone that comes to hug and kiss my cheek always ask me why i feel sooooo hot or like i have a fever when i do not the heat is trapped inside not being able to sweat is known as anhidrosis research it and ask your doctor if this could be your issue i have also found that i have an issue with dehydration and when i drink the amount of water needed for my body weight then it helps reduce my inner heat as well as benefits me in other healthy ways hope this helps this is exactly what happens in a condition recognized by chinese medicine call empty heat or empty fire the clinical manifestations of empty heat in general irrespective of organ are   a feeling of heat in the afternoonevening   a dry mouth with desire to drink in small sips   malar flush red cheekbones   a dry throat at night   a feeling of heat in the chest and palms and soles also called a5 palm heat@   dry stools   scanty dark urine   a floating empty and rapid pulse   a red tongue without coating  <link> applying cold to the outside like air conditioning will only keep the internal heat inside of your body see the url above for more,['skin' 'fever' 'running'],1.0

do saunas contribute to weight loss,the short answer is no generally after time in a sauna you might go to the scale and see that the number is lower but that represents the water you lost from sweating and will increase as soon as you replace those lost fluids which you need to do so you do not become dehydrated while being exposed to high temps can increase your metabolism and slightly increase the number of calories you burn this is only because your body is working to keep your temperature within normal ranges once you leave the environment your metabolism will return to normal bottom line time spent in a sauna would be more effectively used to prepare a healthy meal or more exercise that being said if you enjoy time in the sauna use it as a motivation tool reward yourself with some time in the sauna everytime you visit the gym while i agree with mark about not using a sauna to lose weight saunas do have some inherent health benefits these come in the form of increased circulation which is also great for your skin and hair and relief from some forms of nasal congestion   and of course you can not overlook the benefit of relaxation and what that can do for your well being many cultures around the world have used saunas as an integral part of their daily lives for centuries and have benefited from doing so yes,['weight loss'],1.0

can a women get pregnant after ovulation and while she is having her period,it depends how long after actual ovulation if one knows the actual date of ovulation conception can occur up to 72 hours after ovulation as sperm can live inside the cervix for up to 72 hours under ideal conditions an oocyteegg has at least a 48 hour lifespan after ovulation as you may know the most likely time to conceive is about 14 days before the start of your next period so if one had a regular 28 day cycle ovulation is around day 14 a regular 34 day cycle will have an ovulation around day 20 if one has a regular 24 day cycle ovulation can be as early as cycle day 10 the problem arises among women who have periodsbleeds which are not linked to an ovulation these non ovulatory bleeds can occur randomly as the too thick lining of the uterus begins to shed on its own the woman in this case could have a bleed and then an ovulation anytime thereafter an even more risky scenario would be the women who mistakes bleeding associated with the release of an eggoocyte as a period in that case she could get pregnant from intercourse during her supposed period because she is actually at a very fertile time bottom line getting pregnant during a real period is unlikely  especially if it has been 14 days since ovulation occurred if [there is a concern] do a reliable pregnancy test about two weeks after the date of intercourse a urine test should be reliable around the time of [the] expected period lastly if a woman is really scared about having an unplanned pregnancy the worry can cause her flow to be late  a urine pregnancy test can help resolve any concerns,['period' 'pregnancy' 'ovulation'],1.0

what causes gallstones,there are several types of gallstones and each type has a different cause cholesterol gallstones cholesterol gallstones are made primarily of cholesterol they are the most common type of gallstone comprising 80 of gallstones in individuals from europe and the americas cholesterol is one of the substances that liver cells secrete into bile secretion of cholesterol into bile is an important way in which the liver eliminates excess cholesterol from the body in order for bile to carry cholesterol the cholesterol must be dissolved in the bile cholesterol is a fat however and bile is an aqueous or watery solution fats do not dissolve in watery solutions in order to make the cholesterol dissolve in bile the liver also secretes two detergents    bile acids and lecithin    into the bile these detergents just like dishwashing detergents dissolve the fatty cholesterol so that it can be carried by bile through the ducts if the liver secretes too much cholesterol for the amount of bile acids and lecithin it secretes some of the cholesterol does not dissolve similarly if the liver does not secrete enough bile acids and lecithin some of the cholesterol also does not dissolve in either case the undissolved cholesterol sticks together and forms particles of cholesterol that grow in size and eventually form larger gallstones there are two other processes that promote the formation of cholesterol gallstones though neither process is able to cause cholesterol gallstones by itself the first is abnormally rapid formation and growth of cholesterol particles into gallstones thus with the same concentrations of cholesterol bile acids and lecithin in their bile patients with gallstones form particles of cholesterol more rapidly than individuals without gallstones the second process that promotes the formation and growth of gallstones is reduced contraction and emptying of the gallbladder that allows bile to sit in the gallbladder longer so that there is more time for cholesterol particles to form and grow pigment gallstones pigment gallstones are the second most common type of gallstone although pigment gallstones comprise only 15 of gallstones in individuals from europe and the americas they are more common than cholesterol gallstones in southeast asia there are two types of pigment gallstones 1 black pigment gallstones and 2 brown pigment gallstones pigment is a waste product formed from hemoglobin the oxygen carrying chemical in red blood cells the hemoglobin from old red blood cells that are being destroyed is changed into a chemical called bilirubin and released into the blood bilirubin is removed from the blood by the liver the liver modifies the bilirubin and secretes the modified bilirubin or into bile black pigment gallstones if there is too much bilirubin in bile the bilirubin combines with other constituents in bile for example calcium to form pigment so called because it is dark brown in color pigment dissolves poorly in bile and like cholesterol it sticks together and forms particles that grow in size and eventually form gallstones the pigment gallstones that,['gallstone'],1.0

at what temperature does my baby have a fever,it helps to understand what a fever is some of the answers on here are very misleading and are not factual at all a fever occurs when the body increases in temperature most common cause of this is an infection of some kind the white blood cells that eat the infection release chemicals that go to the brain and tell it to raise the temperature of the body the brain has a set point for our temperature 98 6f it is like a central heatingcooling system with a thermostat in a house if the temp gets hot the ac turns on if it gets to cold the heater kicks on and the temperature stays at 98 6f what these chemicals from the white blood cells do is they increase the thermostat so the brain now has a set point of 101 f but the body is still 98 6 f so the heater kicks on you get shivers moving of muscles fast makes heat you feel cold and you get under covers to get warm this is why people say they are so cold when their temp is 100 because the thermostat is set to 101 or higher the body does this because some of the bodies defenses are activated at higher temperatures and some bacteria do not function well at higher temperatures so they die or we kill them better with a higher temperature so what is it when a fever breaks well eventually your white blood cells kill everything and they stop releasing those chemicals that changes the thermostat so the thermostat changes back to 98 6f now you have a temperature of 101f and your body is set to 98 6f it is too hot turn on the ac so you start sweating to cool yourself off this is a fever breaking so when the person with the fever is sweating like there is no tomorrow it is a good thing and you can probably expect the fever to start going back down fever is a natural defense mechanism against foreign invaders of your body it is very normal as long as my fever is not over 102f it makes sense to me to not interfere with the natural process even help it if i am running a little fever i will get in the hot tub or a nice hot bath fevers can be very dangerous and you should ask your doctor when those dangerous temperatures are they are different for kids and adults to answer the question the fastest easiest way to break a fever is with anti inflammatory medications like tylenol and motrin but that does not mean everything is all better and by the way water is zero calories in case you read the other post do not believe any of that stuff,['fever' 'baby' 'temperature'],-1.0

is there a way to reverse arthritis or slow down the progression of it,a thorough physical exam and a series of tests may be required to diagnose crohn is disease blood tests may be done to check for anemia which could indicate bleeding in the intestines blood tests may also uncover a high white blood cell count which is a sign of inflammation somewhere in the body by testing a stool sample the doctor can tell if there is bleeding or infection in the intestines the doctor may do an upper gastrointestinal gi series to look at the small intestine for this test the patient drinks barium a chalky solution that coats the lining of the small intestine before x rays are taken the barium shows up white on x ray film revealing inflammation or other abnormalities in the intestine the doctor may also do a colonoscopy for this test the doctor inserts an endoscope a long flexible lighted tube linked to a computer and tv monitor into the anus to see the inside of the large intestine the doctor will be able to see any inflammation or bleeding during the exam the doctor may do a biopsy which involves taking a sample of tissue from the lining of the intestine to view with a microscope if these tests show crohn is disease more x rays of both the upper and lower digestive tract may be necessary to see how much is affected by the disease,['arthritis'],-1.0

is there a connection between fibromyalgia and restless legs syndrome,there are a lot of associations in medicine if you have x condition you are likely to suffer from y as well if you are at risk for a you are also at risk for b and probably c as well now we have a new connection to consider in my realm it appears that patients with fibromyalgia have a high prevalence of rls — restless leg syndrome fibromyalgia is a condition that affects the muscles and soft tissue it is considered the most common arthritis related illness after osteoarthritis and its hallmark symptoms include chronic pain in the muscles fatigue sleep problems and painful tender points or trigger points at certain parts of the body it can be difficult to diagnose because there is no single test for the ailment which is why doctors have to rule out other conditions before diagnosing fibromyalgia more than 12 million americans have fibromyalgia most of them are women ranging in age from 25 to 60 women are 10 times more likely to get this disease than men because of the toll fibromyalgia takes on people physically it is no surprise that patients have a harder time getting a good night is sleep as they endure chronic aches and pain but the link found between fibro patients and rls is intriguing fibromyalgia and restless legs syndrome share certain features * women are more likely to suffer from fibromyalgia and rls * there appears to be a genetic component because these conditions run in families rls is equally a mysterious disorder in the sense that we do not know exactly what causes it and as such we do not have a magic bullet for curing it in everyone sometimes an iron deficiency can be to blame for which there is a clear remedy but many patients with rls do not fit into a tidy category whereby the direct cause is known other problems that are sometimes linked to restless legs syndrome include kidney failure rheumatoid arthritis diabetes nerve damage anemia and parkinson is disease but most people who seek treatment do not have any of these other problems pregnancy accounts for many rls cases and contributes to the gender disparity and women who get rls during pregnancy often find that the condition vanishes after giving birth the scientists who published the study on this association pointed out that fibromyalgia and rls share several characteristics both conditions can include sensory alterations the use of antidepressants that can influence the dopamine system and beneficial effects for exercise what is more an important implication of the study according to the researchers is that restless legs syndrome is treatable with drugs that change the dopamine patterns in the brain physicians are urged to ask fibromyalgia patients about symptoms such as leg movements when they are trying to sleep and unpleasant sensations in their legs it goes without saying that alleviating these symptoms can enhance a fibromyalgia patient is experience with sleep and overall quality of life and it,['fibromyalgia' 'restless legs syndrome'],1.0

what is cryotherapy for prostate cancer,cryotherapy is one of the newer treatments that is being evaluated for use in the early stage of prostate cancer this treatment kills the cancer cells by freezing them the freezing is accomplished by inserting a freezing liquid for example liquid nitrogen or argon through needles directly into the prostate gland the procedure is accomplished under the guidance of ultrasound images actually cryotherapy is not a new technique rather it is a modification of a procedure that was tried previously but had an unacceptably high rate of complications thus cryotherapy was used in the 1960s to freeze the lining of the stomach to treat ulcers but was discontinued because it also severely damaged the lining of the stomach at present cryotherapy is recommended for patients with locally advanced prostate cancer who for whatever reason are not candidates for the more established treatments cryotherapy is further being studied to determine which other patients might benefit from this treatment for example studies are under way to establish whether cryotherapy is beneficial as an initial treatment for organ confined localized prostate cancer the effectiveness of cryotherapy in eliminating prostate cancer however has not yet been proven we do know that sometimes the freezing liquid fails to kill all of the cancer cells moreover the potential side effects of this treatment include damage to the urethra and bladder this damage can cause obstruction blockage of the urethra fistulas abnormal tunnels that leak urine or serious infections,['cryosurgery' 'prostate cancer'],1.0

how long can the colon stay alive after surgery  my husband suffered from diverticulitis for about 3 yrs he finally had 9 inches of his colon removed in aug he has the ostomey bag i lost my job and now we have no insurance he was scheduled to be reconnected around the 2nd wk in nov we change his bag once a week his skin around the ostomey area is so red irritated small blister i just want to know how long the colon could be disconnected and still be fully functional,the colon is still functional and viable when the colon is re connected that raw looking ostomy that you are seeing will not be used it will be trimmed off so that there is a fresh area for the anastomosis you are most likely be entitled to cobra insurance from your employer but you may have to do it within 60 days while cobra insurance can be pricey it will be considerably less expensive when compared to the cost of this second surgery there may be other insurance opportunities such as the affordable care insurance as well so please speak with an insurance broker,['colon' 'surgery' 'diverticulitis' 'insurance' 'skin'],1.0

avoid stem cell pills if have lupus is blue green algae a stem cell rejuvenator,that is a great question bravo to you for taking a moment to question the conventional wisdom there are actually a few reasons why we exhort people to drink plenty of fluids when they come down with a cold let is take a look at these first drinking plenty of fluids literally can increase your blood volume and thereby scatter the virus molecules in your system so your own immune system can fight it better think of it this way which is the easier enemy to attack the one with 500 soldiers concentrated together or the one with bands of 10 soldiers dispersed here and there drinking fluid can spread out the virus in your bloodstream so it is easier to attack honestly though drinking fluids by mouth can only do so much in this regard intravenous fluids iv work much better for this purpose second drinking plenty of fluids tends to thin secretions    i e  that nasty gunk that pours from your nose and gets coughed up out of your lungs thinner secretions are easier for the body to move than thick sticky ones thick sticky fluids can get stuck in the lower portions of the lungs and lead to pneumonia if your body can not cough them up in this respect drinking fluids by mouth truly can make a difference in helping your body clear out mucus finally good hydration helps medication work better if you take any sort of over the counter cough and cold product or if you are taking a prescription such as antibiotics it requires liquid water is best to dissolve well in your stomach and get absorbed in the intestines drinking plenty of water also helps your body circulate the active ingredients in those medications more easily so they work better frankly drinking plenty of water and being well hydrated when you have a cold simply can make you feel better water should always be your first choice but chicken soup can not hurt either wishing you well,['lupus' 'stem cell'],-1.0

12 weeks pregnant due jan 20th last period april 15th had sex may 2nd and on april 15 during cycle whose father  i did pregnancy calculator i am guessing it is about 95 may 2nd but still nervous jan 20th minus 38 weeks equals april 29th 30th but had sex on may 2nd but than also took a plan b pill on may 4th about 45 hrs later and still got pregnant,hi again lets see if this helps you so your cycle day 1 first day of your period day 14 give or take a day is ovulation day now you guys sperm needs to be in place for this and it takes 3 days for it to get there after unprotected sex and once its there can live for around 7 days but its best if you have sex around day 9 the sperm splits up some goes the left ovary and some to the right so out pops you egg and away you go hopefully to pregnancy if on day 21 you get spotting its because its implantation day the day the egg implants itself into the womb lining so this you should know yes but the thing is some women can get pregnant from having unprotected sex during there period it can happen some times its our male sperm it lives just that little bit longer and if your egg drops a day early away you go pregnant its a funny old world getting pregnant and there are some women who can get pregnant from anytime of the month again funny old world so as you have already tried to get rid of it have you thought of the abortion pill as your next step this is just a thought hope this helps you good luck,['pregnancy' 'period' 'nervousness' 'sexual intercourse'],1.0
do darker sunglasses provide more protection for the eyes than sunglasses that are less tinted,the amount of uv protection provided by a pair of sunglasses is independent of the amount of tint some dark glasses can provide little uv protection and some lightly tinted glasses may provide 100 protection the key is to read the label on the sunglasses look for an indication that the sunglasses provide 100 uv protection these glasses may be labeled uv400 instead another key to the amount of uv protection will be the lens material polycarbonate lenses generally provide 100 uv protection whereas cr 39 plastic provides 88 protection and cheap triacetate lenses only confer 40 protection,['eyes'],1.0

how bald do i have to be for rogaine to work for me can i use topical rogaine and propecia pills at the same time  how long does it take to see an improvement in my hair,this is a great question and there are actually several questions in there so i will try to address all of them for you first of all the sooner you start using the products whether it is rogaine andor propecia the better off you are because it is much easier to prevent the hair loss than it is to try to fix it afterwards so as soon as you think the hair is starting to shed whether it is in the temple area or in the crown that is when you start going the other good point is that using propecia and rogaine together is better than using either one alone so it does not become like one and one is two it is more like one and one is four or five so they are that much better together it takes about two to three months to begin to see results and in about two years you will get the maximum that you are going to get out of them so not only do these products help prevent hair loss they actually help regrow hair and over time you will see that continue and in about two years you will hit that stabilization point,[''],1.0

what causes veins protruding on the forehead  from behind the right ear to the middle of the forehead appears a bulging vein what is it,it is hard to answer a question like this without a physical examination i can give you some general thoughts on this matter 1 what you are observing could be perfectly normal a vein can appeal to be bulging if a person has very pale skin for example you might look to see if the corresponding vein on the opposite side also appears to be bulging or you might gently press on the vein to see if it feels engorged and stiff especially as compared to the same vein on the left if so then i would suggest you see your primary care provider 2 high blood pressure can cause veins all over the body to bulge it is not uncommon to see bulging veins in the head due to high blood pressure that is another reason why if the vein truly is bulging it would be a good idea to see a doctor please note i am not trying to give any advice specific to your situation these are just general observations whenever you are experiencing something out of the ordinary or something you feel is abnormal it is always ok to see a doctor or other health care provider for an evaluation wishing you all the best,['ears' 'forehead' 'vein'],1.0

how can prostate cancer advanced or metastatic be prevented,hi here is a bit of info i found its interesting being it is about re cum can i get pregnant from pre cum pre cum or pre ejaculatory fluid to call it by it is correct name is a clear fluid that appears on the tip of the penis when a man has an erection and is sufficiently sexually excited it is a common misconception that this fluid is semen that has leaked out before the main ejaculation this is incorrect because this fluid is produced by something called the cowper gland and it is purpose is to flush out the penis before ejaculation so can you get pregnant from pre ejaculatory fluid pre cum well as this fluid does not contain sperm it can not by itself cause a pregnancy however as the purpose of this fluid is to flush out the penis it will bring any sperm left in the penis from the last ejaculation to the tip of the penis if this happens that small amount of sperm could cause a pregnancy if the man has urinated since his last ejaculation the urine would have flushed out and killed any left over sperm in the penis which means in this case a pregnancy would not happen the safest thing is to assume that an erect penis is always capable of causing a pregnancy even before an ejaculation so cover it with a condom before it comes in contact with the vagina good luck,['prostate cancer'],-1.0

my 12 yr old daughter had a lot of blood gush out yesterday but nothing since then could this be her period starting  she has never had any discharge or bleeding before and out of nowhere this gush of bright red blood came out everywhere she has not had anything since then could she be starting menstruation i thought that it would last a few days if it was,maybe if she is well into puberty breast development pubic hair etc  but certainly there are other causes accidental straddle type injuries can cause vaginal or hymen tears some virginal hymens are nearly imperforate little or no opening and an injury could have caused a rupture this sensitive area is rich in blood supply so bleeding can be concerning it may be wise to have her examined by her medical provider hopefully someone who is sensitive and caring and will not cause her undue embarrassment ask her about possible injuries and sadly ask if anyone has touched her inappropriately most of the time however these sudden bleeding episodes are trauma but if they occur again in a cycle this could have been her first period,[''],1.0

how much extra food should i eat while pregnant,pregnancy hormones can play havoc with appetite causing some women to feel famished others are daunted by nausea vomiting and fatigue that diminish their desire for food in both cases the best strategy is trying as much as possible to adhere to a balanced diet that accounts for physical activity and stage of pregnancy like the ones offered at mypyramid gov a nutritious pregnancy eating plan with adequate calories    about 340 more calories each day than your prepregnancy needs starting in the second trimester and about 450 more than your prepregnancy diet during the last three months of pregnancy    should be enough to prevent constant hunger women who are particularly physically active during pregnancy may need more calories however choosing foods that fill you up as part of a balanced pregnancy diet improves eating satisfaction for example whole grains vegetables and legumes are filled with fiber to keep you fuller for longer without any extra calories drink plenty of fluids it works with fiber to keep you full and to prevent constipation a common pregnancy complaint,['pregnancy' 'food'],1.0

will i be fined for failing to buy health insurance i am 53 and make 12 000 a year,this question was sparked no doubt by the much talked about individual mandate which is a central component of the health reform law with some exceptions this provision would require all u s citizens to purchase health insurance or face a penalty beginning in 2014 at 53 with an annual income of 12 000 this reader would likely qualify for medicaid starting in 2014 states will receive additional funding from the federal government to cover the cost of extending medicaid benefits if you are an individual making 14 000 per year or a family of four earning 29 000 or less 133 percent of the federal poverty level you would receive health benefits via medicaid and avoid paying a penalty helping the middle class pay for insurance for the middle class tax credits will be made available to help pay for health plans purchased through health insurance exchanges that will be set up by 2014 if you are an individual making 43 000 or less or a family of four making less than 88 000 the government will subsidize your insurance premiums you may also be eligible for reduced co payments coinsurance and deductibles to assist with the cost of coverage but if you fail to obtain insurance you will be penalized here is how it breaks down starting in 2014 the tax penalty will be 95 and that amount will gradually increase to the greater of 695 per year for individuals 2085 per family or 2 5 percent of a household is income there will be exemptions for financial hardship the individual mandate    a little background the individual mandate was included in the new law as a way of paying for an additional 30 million uninsured americans to have insurance by requiring everyone to pay into the system this is one the most hotly debated aspects of the new law a number of lawsuits have been filed around the country questioning whether or not it is constitutional to require americans to purchase a product in this case health insurance recent rulings in michigan and virginia upheld the new law however earlier this week a federal judge in richmond va ruled against it saying that the individual mandate to purchase health insurance violates the constitution all this is to say that there will be many legal battles between now and 2014 when this mandate is scheduled to take effect ultimately the decision as to whether it is legal for the government to require people to purchase health insurance will likely fall to the supreme court,['insurance' 'health insurance' 'affordable care act' 'medicaid'],1.0

how do i calculate my target heart rate during aerobic exercise,most helpful answer everything i have read says cold if there is tissue damage the cold constricts blood flow which reduces spread of cellular components which can cause rupture of nearby cells making the injury worse and longer to heal heat is not usually applied to an injury until 72 hours have passed this is to increase circulation and promote healing more recent research shows movement of skeletal muscles produces hormone like substances that promote and speed healing of damaged or inflamed tissues throughout the body so if you can move do lastly a small meal of four parts carbs and one part protein within 90 minutes of exercise will help speed muscle recovery the body will use that energy and protein to quickly try to re construct those damaged tissues this information is from exercise physiology,['exercise' 'target heart rate'],-1.0

why are my labia minora lips so big i have never seen anyone with them so large they stick outhang down almost an inch and a half i feel like a freak of nature i have never seen anything like it why am i like this how could i be made to look normal the older i get the worse they look,this is a great question so many consumers and patients are coming with these type of products to the counter and saying hey can you help me figure out if this is right for me once again this is an over the counter product they are usually in the vitamin and herbal section we have limited data on whether or not they work we do not know what they are active ingredients sometimes are so we want to make sure that patients are really careful about this one of the things encountering in the diet area is the fact that people who have cardiac conditions or high blood pressure these may not be the right choices for them once again the physician or healthcare provider needs to see this and evaluate you based on that first before we go and choose any over the counter supplement people might think oh it is just something minor because i just feel like i gained a few pounds of water weight but that can make a really big difference especially if you have high blood pressure or certain lung disorders like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd all these things kind of come into play so i really want consumers and patients to understand that we know these products are out there but we want to make sure we make the right choices and education is the best way to go so ask a question first and find out if it is the right product for you they could have an adverse reaction the other thing is too is that sometimes they contain byproducts that people that may have allergic reactions to a filler or a salt or a particular root that they found like a lot of them come with more natural products like leaves or roots from trees and a lot of people are starting to break out from those because they have never been exposed to them before so once again be really careful about the choices that we are making,['lip'],-1.0

i have colon cancer stage 3b i have abdomen pain mri of omentum and lesions of concern,as a plastic and reconstructive surgery nurse i worked with many women who had large breasts that caused rashes or neck pain here is what i can tell you the type of procedure you are looking for is breast reduction not augmentation breast reduction surgery will reduce the overall size of your breasts as well as perking them up  so they sit in a more natural position many insurance companies will cover breast reduction under certain conditions for example serious neck pain that does not respond to any other treatment like physical therapy and can be attributed to large breasts may be covered with rashes insurance companies seem in my experience less likely to cover breast reduction unless the rashes recur frequently and have not responded to other treatments you need to have documentation that you have seen your primary care provider multiple times and have tried prescription creams or whatever without clearing up the rashes for more than short periods of time also with rashes your insurance may be less likely to cover the procedure if you are obese because in theory reducing the size of your abdomen might help the rash problem if you have tried without success to medically treat the rashes i would suggest you schedule an appointment with a plastic and reconstructive surgeon to discuss your options he or she will not be able to tell you if your insurance will cover a breast reduction but the surgeon can give you an opinion on whether you might benefit from breast reduction and can submit the claim for prior authorization after that it is up to the individual insurer you need to know that breast reduction can impair your ability to nurse a baby it is doubtful you would be completely unable to nurse but removing breast tissue does reduce the number of milk ducts which can reduce the volume of milk your baby is able to get from nursing hope this helps,['colon cancer stage 3b' 'omentum'],-1.0

what new procedures are being considered for bags under the eyes,last week i attended a two day seminar on plastic surgery at the cedars sinai medical center here in the beverly hills area it was excellent we had terrific speakers from various sub specialties including facial plastic surgery general plastic surgery ophthalmic plastic surgery and cosmetic dermatology one of the more interesting subjects was how we surgeons now view the treatment of the aging lower eyelids because of the stellar performance of filling solutions such as restylane juvaderm perlane sculptra radiesse and artefill we are exploring new roles for these products the sense now is that we can be more conservative about taking out the extra fatty tissue of the lower eyelids one reason is that often the fat bag prominence is partly due to shrinkage of the fat over the cheek bones just below the lower eyelid fat bag so the contrast between the bulging of the fat and the flatness of the adjacent cheek tissue renders the fat more visible and unsatisfactory consequently many surgeons are evaluating the appearance that follows after merely using filling injections along the lower rim of the orbital bone in other words the hill does not look so high when you fill the adjacent valley for many patients that is all they need some patients will still need a chemical skin peel or laser treatment to help tighten the lower eyelid skin is fine lines or wrinkles others have darkness of the skin which is the most difficult problem and our scientific artillery is not yet good enough consistently for that although there are some new bleach creams that seem promising i enjoy attending these continuing medical education seminars because we collectively are probing and searching — always — for better and safer treatments for patients such is the history of all medical practice for thousands of years remember “science never sleeps ”,['eyes'],1.0

how will my doctor determine the best treatment for my prostate cancer,ok there are a number of different factors that play into whether this prostate cancer is going to be significant obviously we want to know the volume of the cancer is there a lot there obviously the more there is the worse it is and we want to know the grain how aggressive it is is this like a little puppy or is it like a doberman with rabies the more aggressive the cancer the worse the prognosis the more likely you will need aggressive therapy and the larger volume also has a role and we also do studies to evaluate has it spread is it just in one little area or has it spread so that is the two factors that we look at in determining how aggressive this cancer will or will not be for you then we have to look at the factors that relate to you what is your health what is your age how old were your parents when they died if not if your father died at age 50 and you are 47 then    sl ok we will go back to that so um if your father is 50 years old when he died and you are 47 then we may not be as aggressive with higher risk treatments if on the other hand you are 57 and your father is 94 and still active vibrant healthy then we need to consider that you probably have 40 years ahead of you and we will be more aggressive we also need to look at your health if you have any heart disease blood vessel disease diabetes if you are out climbing mountains and hiking the grand canyon and you are 63 then we are going to want to be more aggressive as well so all of those factors go into determining the nature of what the threat is because we never want the treatment worse than the disease we know that for the majority of men prostate cancer will not kill them so we want to customize treatment if you are young and healthy we may be more aggressive if you are old and have health problems we probably will not,['prostate cancer'],1.0

can a type 1 diabetic use over the counter sinus and allergy medicine,before using any over the counter medication diabetics should first discuss with their doctor whether the medication is safe and appropriate a common medication used for runny noses is a decongestant decongestants are available either as a pill or as a nasal spray common decongestants found in pill form include pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine both of these ingredients may raise blood glucose and blood pressure levels people with diabetes should only use decongestants cautiously and under the direction of a doctor because of its misuse and side effects pseudoephedrine is found behind the pharmacy counter this measure means that pharmacists can make sure that pseudoephedrine is being used appropriately phenylephrine may be found on the store shelves remember that many cold medications contain multiple ingredients be sure to read carefully all the ingredients in a preparation many cold preparations contain non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids such as ibuprofen advil or naproxen aleve these agents can be harmful to the kidneys of diabetics and if pain is not an issue may not be needed therefore buying separate ingredients rather than a combination medication may be safer a nasal decongestant works more quickly than a decongestant taken by mouth this preparation is sprayed into each nostril nasal decongestants usually do not have a significant effect on blood glucose or blood pressure levels because their effect is mainly local however if used excessively they can have effects on glucose and blood pressure the important downside to nasal decongestants is a possible rebound effect that makes your nose even more congested if you use them for more than 3 to 5 days for that reason they are best for short lived colds and not for persistent allergies saline nasal sprays are safe for diabetics and do no affect blood glucose levels nasal strips are another good option and are available over the counter the strips work by mechanically opening the nostrils antihistamines are a commonly used for a runny nose antihistamines can help dry a runny nose due to an allergy but are not helpful for a runny nose due to the common cold antihistamines do not raise blood glucose levels and are usually safe for diabetics however some of the older over the counter antihistamines cause sleepiness this can be a real problem in diabetics especially when combined with sedatives or alcohol diphenhydramine benadryl is an antihistamine that causes sleepiness but fexofenadine allegra loratadine claritin and cetirizine zyrtec are less sedating the most important step though in treating your symptoms is to be sure you have the correct diagnosis go over your symptoms and signs with your doctor many times what seems to be an allergy may in fact be a bacterial sinus infection bacterial sinus infections are common in diabetics and need to be treated with antibiotics which are only available by prescription so do not rush out and buy an over the counter preparation without first talking with your provider,['diabetes' 'sinus' 'over the counter'],1.0

what is myopathy,fiber is typically beneficial in alleviating constipation but too much without enough water can actually cause constipation keep in mind that there are two types of fiber soluble and insoluble soluble fiber slows digestion and helps you absorb nutrients from food where insoluble fiber adds bulk to your stool helping it to pass more quickly through the intestines most plant foods contain some of each but insoluble fiber is more common in wheat bran whole grains cereals seeds and the skins of many fruits and vegetables you may have added too much fiber too soon it might be beneficial to temporarily decrease your fiber intake for now so that you can slowly and gradually reintroduce it back into your diet allowing your body time to adjust to it better you are correct in drinking plenty of fluids since water is necessary to help fiber move stool out of your body if you eat too much fiber without enough water you can become constipated so it may be worthwhile to also drink more water even if you feel as though you are getting enough according to the academy of nutrition and dietetics women should aim for 25 grams of fiber per day and men should aim for 38 grams per day after the age of 50 the recommendations for fiber drop to 21 grams per day for women and 30 grams per day for men you and your doctor may discuss different needs based on your current health conditions another idea may be to try to incorporate foods that might have a natural laxative effect such as prunes psyllium seed husk bran and methylcellulose to alleviate your constipation some people just respond poorly to increases in fiber so it may be beneficial to discuss this further with your doctor thanks for your answer doctor i have stopped the fiber it was metamucil so it was psyillium and now i am back to normal i was also drinking double up on the water and my stomach doubled in size with the bloating i may try to do just one of the wafers a day instead of the 4 i worked my way up to but then again since my pain stopped and my stools resumed to normal i do not understand the need i also do eat fruit and vegetables already as well i think i will listen to my body rather than the you need to do this type of advise we are getting over all i can say in my case fiber is not the answer to life lol,[''],-1.0

how conclusive is a facial skin biopsy to diagnose systemic lupus erythematosus sle,when persons with systemic lupus erythematosus sle have involvement of the skin of the face several skin abnormalities can occur these include malar erythema butterfly rash discoid lupus and subacute cutaneous lupus a biopsy of the skin will show changes of the skin that are characteristic of lupus in a majority of patients therefore in helping the doctor to diagnose lupus the skin biopsy can be very important especially when other criteria for lupus are absent the biopsy findings in the skin will usually demonstrate inflammation in a particular level of the skin layers between the dermis and epidermis moreover if special antibody staining tests immunoflourescent stains for immune deposits are also performed take three weeks for results then antibodies can be noted to be deposited at the junction of the dermis and epidermis the antibodies form a line of fluorescence when viewed under a microscope and this type of examination has been referred to as a lupus band test  it is positive when performed in involved skin in 90 of patients interestingly it is also positive in uninvolved sun exposed skin in 80 of patients and in uninvolved non sun exposed skin in 50 therefore in some settings doctors will do a biopsy of skin of the arm in an attempt to evaluate a facial rash of certain patients with lupus when this test is abnormal demonstrates antibodies deposited at the junction of the dermis and epidermis skin disease from sle is felt to be present there is also some research that describes an increased risk for more serious forms of systemic lupus in those patients with an abnormal lupus band test in the proper setting the results of a skin biopsy can directly influence the doctor is decision for optimal treatments,['lupus' 'skin' 'biopsy'],1.0

why does diarrhea develop,with diarrhea stools usually are looser whether or not the frequency of bowel movements is increased this looseness of stool    which can vary all the way from slightly soft to watery    is caused by increased water in the stool during normal digestion food is kept liquid by the secretion of large amounts of water by the stomach upper small intestine pancreas and gallbladder food that is not digested reaches the lower small intestine and colon in liquid form the lower small intestine and particularly the colon absorb the water turning the undigested food into a more or less solid stool with form increased amounts of water in stool can occur if the stomach andor small intestine secretes too much fluid the distal small intestine and colon do not absorb enough water or the undigested liquid food passes too quickly through the small intestine and colon for enough water to be removed of course more than one of these abnormal processes may occur at the same time for example some viruses bacteria and parasites cause increased secretion of fluid either by invading and inflaming the lining of the small intestine inflammation stimulates the lining to secrete fluid or by producing toxins chemicals that also stimulate the lining to secrete fluid but without causing inflammation inflammation of the small intestine andor colon from bacteria or from ileitiscolitis can increase the rapidity with which food passes through the intestines reducing the time that is available for absorbing water conditions of the colon such as collagenous colitis can block the ability of the colon to absorb water diarrhea generally is divided into two types acute and chronic acute diarrhea lasts from a few days up to a week chronic diarrhea can be defined in several ways but almost always lasts more than three weeks it is important to distinguish between acute and chronic diarrhea because they usually have different causes require different diagnostic tests and require different treatment,['diarrhea'],1.0

what is the difference between the fat burning mode and the cardio mode on the machines at the gym,using the fat burning mode on exercise machines at the gym actually is not the best way to burn fat the key concepts to understand here are the percentage of calories that come from fat and total calories the fat burning mode is typically set at lower exercise intensity where more calories burned come from fat not as many calories burned during higher exercise intensity will come from fat the point to understand though is that while more of the calories that you burn will come from fat at a lower exercise intensity you have the potential to burn more calories per session doing higher exercise intensity the percentage of calories burned from fat will be lower during the higher exercise intensity but you will be burning more calories overall including the amount of calories from fat also higher exercise intensity leads to a greater boost in metabolism even after you are done exercising which burns additional calories it is best to do exercise that you are comfortable with and that meets your level of trainingconditioning in general however increasing the time spent on exercise and increasing exercise intensity will provide a greater potential to burn more calories and lose weight,['burn'],1.0

throat hurts growth on feet appear fever too,it is difficult to give you a straight answer without a bit more background information but let me at least explain a common misconception about thyroid lab tests and results so that you can talk to your healthcare provider about your concerns usually thyroid function is measured using a blood test that looks at tsh thyroid stimulating hormone a high tsh number means a low level of circulating thyroid hormone in your blood that seems backwards does not it a low tsh number means you have a higher level of thyroid hormone in your blood so if your tsh lab result was high  you may still be hypothyroid if your tsh lab result was low  you may be considered in the normal range or in the hyperthyroid range if in fact you have moved from hypothyroidism to hyperthyroidism overactive thyroid gland your healthcare provider will discuss ways of treating this condition in general thyroid disorders are highly treatable you should make an appointment with your healthcare provider to discuss your recent lab results and what they mean that way you will have peace of mind about what is really going on and what treatment options are available to you,['growth on feet' 'throat hurts'],-1.0
